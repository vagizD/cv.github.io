  Hello! My name is Vagiz. I learn and practice to be good at analyzing data, making predictions, and being Python proficient coder. I like taking my time to achieve goals and show myself the results that I was not capable of sometime ago (about my cooking skills, do not mess it up:).
  
  Favourites: <mark>Chocolate</mark>, <mark>Guitar</mark>, <mark>Waterpolo</mark>, and <mark>Data</mark>.

          Analysis of credits dataset with visualizations, explanations, and machine learning estimators testing. 
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
           Credits are the main power of bank systems. Being able to separate potential overdues from disciplined returns is a crucial classification task. It is the most complicated and unsusual test task which I completed as a first-step competition for a job position. Used tools: <mark>LogisticRegression</mark>, <mark>RandomForestClassifier</mark>, <mark>CatBoostClassifier</mark> estimators from <mark>scikit-learn</mark> and <mark>catboost</mark> Machine Learning libraries; <mark>matplotlib</mark> and <mark>seaborn</mark> libraries for data visualizations; <mark>pandas</mark> and <mark>numpy</mark> for data manipulation.

          The understanding of math and logic behind classical Machine Learning algorithms.
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
           Machine Learning algorithms are used to make predictions. Strong foundation of data science is to understand these algorithms. Currently, there are <mark>LinearRegression</mark> with Gradient Descent and <mark>DecisionTreeClassifier</mark>.

          Solution to Kaggle competition "Catch Me If You Can".
        description: |
          Competition is based on which sites the user visited and what time the visit happened. Task is similar to real-world examples of frauds. "Burglars" behave differently from actual users and webtracking helps to identify these "key" patterns.
