          DS specialist in fintech company [Devim](https://devim.com/). Here are some tasks I've completed:

          * [Sampling algorithm](https://github.com/vagizD/sampling-algorithm). The algorithm is designed specifically for certain 
          problem - to sample dataset of issued credits such that its distribution is similar to the TTD dataset.
          * Build data pipelines using Airflow.
          * Compared ML algorithms using business metrics.
          * Analysis of fraud cases.
          * Various scripting/parsing python tasks.
          * Other data engineering.

      * Classic ML algorithms (classification, regression, clustering) and their mathematical motivation.
      * Deep Learning algorithms (Artificial NN, CNN, RNN) and their mathematical motivation.
      * Data Engineering (basic Airflow, MySQL, Postgres, Clickhouse).
      * Python, C++.
      * Git.
      * Libraries toolkit: numpy, polars, seaborn, matplotlib, sklearn, tensorflow.

          Analysis of credits dataset with visualizations, explanations, and machine learning estimators testing. 
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
           Credits are the main power of bank systems. Being able to separate potential overdues from disciplined returns is a crucial classification task. It is the most complicated and unsusual test task which I completed as a first-step competition for a job position. Used tools: <mark>LogisticRegression</mark>, <mark>RandomForestClassifier</mark>, <mark>CatBoostClassifier</mark> estimators from <mark>scikit-learn</mark> and <mark>catboost</mark> Machine Learning libraries; <mark>matplotlib</mark> and <mark>seaborn</mark> libraries for data visualizations; <mark>pandas</mark> and <mark>numpy</mark> for data manipulation.
