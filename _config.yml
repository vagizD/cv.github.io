  Hello! My name is Vagiz. I learn and practice to be good at analyzing data, making predictions, and being a proficient coder. I like taking my time to achieve goals and show myself the results that I was not capable of sometime ago (about my cooking skills, do not mess it up:).
  
  Favourites: <mark>Chocolate</mark>, <mark>Guitar</mark>, <mark>Sport</mark>, and <mark>Data</mark>.

          Analysis of credits dataset with visualizations, explanations, and machine learning estimators testing. 
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
           Credits are the main power of bank systems. Being able to separate potential overdues from disciplined returns is a crucial classification task. It is the most complicated and unsusual test task which I completed as a first-step competition for a job position. Used tools: <mark>LogisticRegression</mark>, <mark>RandomForestClassifier</mark>, <mark>CatBoostClassifier</mark> estimators from <mark>scikit-learn</mark> and <mark>catboost</mark> Machine Learning libraries; <mark>matplotlib</mark> and <mark>seaborn</mark> libraries for data visualizations; <mark>pandas</mark> and <mark>numpy</mark> for data manipulation.

          Sampling dataset to fit another distribution.
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          The algorithm is designed specifically for certain problem - to sample dataset of issued credits such that its distribution (across some defined number of features) is approximately the same as the TTD dataset (which contains all credits, both approved (divides further into issued and not issued) and not approved). The final dataset is used to test ROC AUC score of ML models before being deployed into production pipeline. Since they are build to predict which clients will overdue credits, train and test sets must be labeled but also similar in distribution to the TTD dataset.
